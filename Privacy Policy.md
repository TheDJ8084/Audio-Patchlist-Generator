# Privacy Policy for the Audio Patchlist Generator

## 1. Description of the Service
The Audio Patchlist Generator is a Google Docs add-on. The Add-on simplifies the process of creating audio patchlists and tables. The script runs entirely within the Google Apps Script environment and does not require any external servers to function.

## 2. Information We Collect
The Add-on does not collect any personal information from users. We do not store usernames, email addresses, document content, or any other data.

The Add-on accesses your Google Docs document to create the tables. This access is strictly limited to the active document, and the Add-on does not store, share, or transmit any data outside of the Google Apps Script environment.

## 3. How We Use Information
Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use it.

The Add-on uses its document editing permissions solely to generate tables based on the inputs you provide in the sidebar.

## 4. Sharing Information with Third Parties
We do not share any information with third parties because we do not collect any information.

## 5. Security
Your data is protected by Google Workspace's security protocols. The Add-on itself has no built-in data storage mechanisms, which minimizes the risk of data breaches through our Add-on.

## 6. Changes to this Policy
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon being posted on this page.
